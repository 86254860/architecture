# HyperFleet Release Process - Spike Report

**Document Status:** Draft
**Date:** 2026-01-29
**Last Updated:** 2026-03-18

---

## Executive Summary

This spike report defines a comprehensive release process for HyperFleet (API service, Sentinel, and Adapter Framework). The proposed process balances agility with stability, leveraging existing Prow infrastructure while establishing clear gates, workflows, and artifacts for production releases.

**Key Recommendations:**
- **Hybrid release cadence:** Regular 3-week (1-sprint) releases for quality + ad-hoc releases for urgent requirements
- Git branching strategy with release branches and cherry-pick workflow
- **Independent component versioning:** Each component (API Service, Sentinel, Adapter Framework) maintains its own semantic version
- Validated HyperFleet releases defined by compatibility-tested component version combinations
- Multi-gate release readiness criteria including automated and manual validation
- Structured bug triage workflow post-code freeze
- Comprehensive release artifacts including container images, Helm charts, and documentation
- **Start with Prow + manual release for MVP**, plan Konflux migration (with Enterprise Contract Policy support) for Post-MVP

---

## 1. Release Entry Criteria

These criteria determine when the development team can initiate the release process and enter code freeze.

### 1.1 Feature Completeness Criteria

**Feature Freeze Gate:**
- ✓ All planned features for the release milestone are code-complete
- ✓ Feature toggles are in place for any experimental or incomplete features if applicable
- ✓ Feature documentation is drafted (can be finalized during code freeze)

**Technical Debt Assessment:**
- ✓ No known security vulnerabilities rated HIGH or CRITICAL remain unaddressed (once konflux job is supported) 
- ✓ Technical debt has been reviewed and acceptable items are explicitly deferred to next release
- ✓ All deprecated APIs have migration paths documented

### 1.2 Testing & Quality Gates

- **CI/CD Pipeline Health:** Prow CI pipeline is green for all components on the main branch, validating:
  - Unit tests: Passing consistently (coverage ensured by pre-submit jobs, not part of release gating)
  - Integration tests: Passing consistently
  - E2E tests: Critical user journeys validated
  - Performance regression tests: No degradation >10% vs. previous release (once performance testing is supported)

- **Build**:
  - Container images: Build successfully for all target architectures
  - Helm charts: Package without errors

### 1.3 Cross-Component Dependencies

**Version Compatibility:**
- ✓ Each component uses independent semantic versioning (see Section 2.5)
- ✓ HyperFleet Release X.Y defines a validated, compatibility-tested set of component versions
- ✓ Compatibility matrix documented showing which component versions work together
- ✓ Breaking changes (if any) are documented with migration guides and version requirements
- ✓ Backward compatibility: Each component supports N-1 version upgrade paths independently
- ✓ Cross-component API contracts validated during integration testing

### 1.4 Documentation Readiness

- ✓ Release notes draft exists with major features listed
- ✓ Known issues and limitations are documented
- ✓ Upgrade/migration documentation is drafted (if applicable)
- ✓ API documentation is up-to-date

### 1.5 Organizational Readiness

- ✓ Release Owner identified and assigned
- ✓ Stakeholder communication plan is in place

**Decision Point:** When all criteria above are met, the Release Owner can call for Feature Freeze and transition to code stabilization phase.

---

## 2. Code Freeze and Branching Strategy

### 2.1 Branching Model

HyperFleet follows a **release branch workflow** based on Kubernetes and OpenShift best practices:

```text
main (development branch)
  │
  │ Active Development Phase
  │
  ├─── release-X.Y (branch created at Feature Freeze)
  │      │
  │      │ Stabilization Phase (bug fixes only)
  │      │
  │      │ Code Freeze (critical fixes only)
  │      │
  │      ├─── vX.Y.0-rc.1 (tag - Release Candidate 1)
  │      ├─── vX.Y.0-rc.2 (tag - Release Candidate 2, if needed)
  │      └─── vX.Y.0 (tag - GA Release)
  │
  │ (main branch continues with X.Y+1 development)
  │
  └─── (next release cycle)

After GA:
release-X.Y (branch maintained post-release)
  │
  ├─── vX.Y.1 (tag - Z-stream/patch release, NO RC)
  ├─── vX.Y.2 (tag - Z-stream/patch release, NO RC)
  └─── ... (support window: 6 months)
```

**Note on Z-Stream (Patch) Releases:**
- Z-stream releases (vX.Y.1, vX.Y.2, etc.) **do not require Release Candidate (RC) tags**
- These releases go directly from testing to GA tag
- Scope limited to bug fixes, security patches, and minor improvements (no new features or breaking changes)
- Faster turnaround for low-risk fixes while maintaining quality gates

### 2.2 Timeline and Freeze Process

**Sprint-Based Release Cycle (3 weeks / 1 sprint):**

**Timeline Breakdown:**
- **Weeks 1-2 (Development Phase):** Active feature development, normal PR process on `main` branch
  - Continuous testing on all PRs (unit, integration, linting)
  - Documentation written alongside code
  - Features merged as they're completed
- **Week 3 (Stabilization & Release Phase):**
  - Feature Freeze - create `release-X.Y` branch, cut RC.1
  - `main` branch reopens immediately for next release development
  - Bug fixes cherry-picked from `main`
  - Full E2E test suite execution (automated + manual)
  - Documentation finalization
  - Code Freeze - only critical/blocker fixes with Release Owner approval
  - Final validation and sign-off
  - GA release tagged and published with all artifacts

**Note:** This 3-week cadence is designed for HyperFleet as a new product requiring rapid feedback cycles with pillar teams. Since CI/CD automation is currently being built, the Stabilization & Release Phase (Week 3) may take longer in the initial releases. As the product matures and automation capabilities improve, the team should continuously refine and optimize the release cadence based on actual data and lessons learned from each release cycle.

### 2.3 Code Freeze Mechanics

**Feature Freeze:**
```bash
# Release Owner creates release branch from main (per component repo)
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b release-1.5
git push origin release-1.5

# Create first release candidate (per component version)
git tag -a v1.5.0-rc.1 -m "API Service RC1 for v1.5.0"
git push origin v1.5.0-rc.1
```

**After Feature Freeze:**
- `main` branch reopens immediately for next release (v1.6) development
- All changes to `release-1.5` branch must be cherry-picked from `main` or created as hotfix PRs
- Release Owner reviews and approves all PRs to release branch

**Code Freeze:**
- Only Critical or above bug fixes allowed into release branch (Blocker, Critical)
- Each fix requires:
  - Bug severity: Critical or above (Blocker, Critical)
  - Release Owner approval
  - Successful test run in Prow
  - Risk assessment documented

**Cherry-Pick Process:**

**Standard Fix (Preferred):**
1. Create PR to fix bug in `main` branch → Merge
2. Cherry-pick the fix to release branch via new PR → Release Owner approves

**Release-Specific Fix (Only if bug doesn't exist in main):**
1. Create PR directly to `release-X.Y` branch → Release Owner approves

### 2.4 Release Branch Maintenance

**Support Policy:** 6 months with lifecycle stages

Every release receives 6 months of support from its GA date, divided into two phases:

#### Phase 1: Full Support (first 3 months)
- All bug fixes and enhancements
- Patch releases for any severity (Major+)
- Active maintenance

#### Phase 2: Security Maintenance (months 3-6)
- CRITICAL and HIGH security vulnerabilities only
- Blocker bugs affecting production stability
- Limited patch releases

#### After 6 months: End of Life (EOL)
- No further updates
- Users must upgrade to supported version

#### Backport Decision Tree:
- Version < 3 months old: Backport all Major+ severity bugs
- Version 3-6 months old: Backport only CRITICAL/HIGH CVEs and Blockers
- Version > 6 months old: EOL, no backports

### 2.5 Versioning Strategy

**HyperFleet uses independent component versioning** with validated release combinations.

Each core component (API Service, Sentinel, Adapter Framework) maintains its own semantic version number, evolving at its own pace based on changes and feature development.

```text
HyperFleet Release 1.5 (validated combination):
├─ api-service: v1.5.0
├─ sentinel: v1.4.2
└─ adapter-framework: v2.0.0
```

**Rationale:**
- **Flexibility:** Components can evolve independently without forcing artificial version bumps
- **Semantic accuracy:** Version numbers reflect actual changes (v1.4.2 → v1.4.3 for bug fix, not v1.4.2 → v1.5.0)
- **Efficient releases:** Components without changes don't require new versions or rebuilds
- **Clear change tracking:** Each component's version history accurately reflects its evolution
- **Industry standard:** Aligns with microservices best practices (Kubernetes components, cloud services)

**HyperFleet Release Number:**
- Defines a validated, compatibility-tested set of component versions
- Format: "HyperFleet Release X.Y" (e.g., Release 1.5, Release 1.6)
- Documented in release notes with full compatibility matrix
- Simplifies user experience: "Install HyperFleet Release 1.5" with clear component version mapping

#### 2.5.1 Branching and Tagging Rules

**Key Principles:**
1. **Independent branching:** Each component creates release branches based on its own version (e.g., `release-1.5`, `release-2.0`)
2. **Independent tagging:** Each component tags releases according to its semantic version (e.g., `v1.5.0`, `v1.4.2`, `v2.0.0`)
3. **Selective releases:** Only components with changes create new release branches and tags

**Why?** Components evolve at their own pace, and version numbers should accurately reflect actual changes.

**Component-Specific Releases:**

Between HyperFleet releases, individual components can issue releases independently:

```bash
# Example: Critical bug found in Sentinel after HyperFleet Release 1.5 GA
# Current: HyperFleet Release 1.5 (API v1.5.0, Sentinel v1.4.2, Adapter v2.0.0)

# Sentinel creates patch release v1.4.3
cd openshift-hyperfleet/sentinel
git checkout release-1.4
# Apply fix, test
git tag -a v1.4.3 -m "Sentinel v1.4.3 - Hotfix for metrics bug"
git push origin v1.4.3

# Result: Users can upgrade just Sentinel v1.4.2 → v1.4.3 without full release
# No new HyperFleet Release number needed for single-component release
```

**When to Create Component Release vs HyperFleet Release:**

**Component Release:**

Create a component release only for isolated, fully backward-compatible fixes within a single component that do not impact APIs, schemas, cross-component behavior, or coordinated platform upgrades.

**HyperFleet Release:**

Create a HyperFleet release whenever a change affects supported platform users, introduces cross-component compatibility or contract implications, delivers security or critical stability fixes, or requires coordinated, platform-wide, validated upgrades.

**Supporting Repository Branching for HyperFleet Releases:**

When creating a HyperFleet release, the following supporting repositories also participate in the release process:

**For Major/Minor Releases (e.g., HyperFleet Release 1.5):**

1. **hyperfleet-e2e** - E2E test suites
   - Create `release-1.5` branch at Feature Freeze
   - Contains E2E tests validating the specific component combinations for this release

2. **hyperfleet-infra** - Infrastructure configurations
   - Create `release-1.5` branch at Feature Freeze (if infrastructure changes needed)
   - Contains deployment scripts, cluster configs aligned with this release

3. **hyperfleet-release** - Release coordination and documentation
   - Create `release-1.5` branch at Feature Freeze
   - Contains release notes, compatibility matrices, installation guides
   - Tag the release: `release-1.5` at GA

**For Patch Releases (e.g., HyperFleet Release 1.5.1, 1.5.2):**

Supporting repositories **do not create new branches** for patch releases:

1. **hyperfleet-e2e, hyperfleet-infra**
   - Stay on existing `release-1.5` branch
   - Commit updates/fixes to the same branch as needed

2. **hyperfleet-release**
   - Stay on existing `release-1.5` branch
   - Update release notes and compatibility matrix
   - **Create new tag** for each patch: `release-1.5.1`, `release-1.5.2`

   ```bash
   # Example: HyperFleet Release 1.5.1 (patch)
   cd openshift-hyperfleet/hyperfleet-release
   git checkout release-1.5

   # Update release notes with patch changes
   # (e.g., API Service v1.5.0 → v1.5.1)

   # Tag the patch release
   git tag -a release-1.5.1 -m "HyperFleet Release 1.5.1 (API v1.5.1, Sentinel v1.4.2, Adapter v2.0.0)"
   git push origin release-1.5.1
   ```

**Rationale:** Patch releases are incremental updates on the same base release. Supporting repos use the same branch infrastructure with updated content and new tags to mark each patch version.

#### 2.5.2 Practical Example: HyperFleet Release 1.5

**Scenario:**
- API Service: **Major feature** (new GitOps integration) → Version bump to v1.5.0
- Sentinel: **Bug fixes only** → Patch version bump to v1.4.2
- Adapter Framework: **Breaking changes** → Major version bump to v2.0.0

**At Feature Freeze - Create Component-Specific Release Branches:**

```bash
# API Service - MINOR version bump (new features)
cd openshift-hyperfleet/api-service
git checkout -b release-1.5 && git push origin release-1.5

# Sentinel - PATCH version bump (bug fixes only)
cd openshift-hyperfleet/sentinel
git checkout -b release-1.4 && git push origin release-1.4
# (or cherry-pick to existing release-1.4 if it exists)

# Adapter Framework - MAJOR version bump (breaking changes)
cd openshift-hyperfleet/adapter-framework
git checkout -b release-2.0 && git push origin release-2.0
```

**At GA Release - Tag Each Component with Its Own Version:**

```bash
# API Service - Tag v1.5.0 (new minor version)
cd openshift-hyperfleet/api-service
git checkout release-1.5
git tag -a v1.5.0 -m "API Service v1.5.0 - GitOps integration"
git push origin v1.5.0

# Sentinel - Tag v1.4.2 (patch release)
cd openshift-hyperfleet/sentinel
git checkout release-1.4
git tag -a v1.4.2 -m "Sentinel v1.4.2 - Memory leak fix"
git push origin v1.4.2

# Adapter Framework - Tag v2.0.0 (major version)
cd openshift-hyperfleet/adapter-framework
git checkout release-2.0
git tag -a v2.0.0 -m "Adapter Framework v2.0.0 - Plugin API v2"
git push origin v2.0.0
```

**Result:**
```text
HyperFleet Release 1.5 (validated combination):

Component Release Branches:
- api-service: release-1.5
- sentinel: release-1.4
- adapter-framework: release-2.0

Component Version Tags:
- api-service: v1.5.0
- sentinel: v1.4.2
- adapter-framework: v2.0.0

Container Images (for HyperFleet Release 1.5):
- registry.ci.openshift.org/hyperfleet/api-service:v1.5.0
- registry.ci.openshift.org/hyperfleet/sentinel:v1.4.2
- registry.ci.openshift.org/hyperfleet/adapter-framework:v2.0.0

Compatibility:
- API Service v1.5.0 requires Adapter Framework ≥ v2.0.0
- Sentinel v1.4.2 is compatible with Adapter Framework v1.x and v2.x
- Full compatibility matrix documented in release notes
```

## 3. Release Readiness Criteria

Before declaring a release as "GA-Ready", all the following criteria must be satisfied:

### 3.0 Prow Job Configuration for Release Branches

After creating release branches for components and supporting repositories, Prow jobs must be configured to support release branch builds and testing.

**Required Prow Job Configuration:**

**1. Copy Build Jobs for Release Images**

After cutting component release branches (e.g., `release-1.5` for API Service, `release-1.4` for Sentinel):

- **Action:** Copy existing Prow jobs that build container images from `main` branch
- **Update:** Configure copied jobs to trigger on release branch commits
- **Purpose:** Enable automated image builds from release branches when fixes are merged
- **Result:** Release images automatically built and pushed to registry when release branch is updated

**2. Copy E2E Prow Jobs for Nightly Release Testing**

After cutting `hyperfleet-e2e` release branch (e.g., `release-1.5`):

- **Action:** Copy E2E test Prow jobs that run nightly on `main` branch
- **Update:** Configure copied jobs to:
  - Run against the release branch E2E test suite
  - Test the validated component version combination for this release
  - Trigger nightly to detect regressions in release branch
- **Purpose:** Continuous validation of release stability throughout support lifecycle
- **Result:** Early detection of issues in release branches before they reach users

**Best Practices:**
- Copy jobs at Feature Freeze when release branches are created
- Maintain consistent naming convention: `{job-name}-release-X.Y`
- Monitor nightly release test results for regressions
- Disable nightly jobs when release reaches EOL (after 6 months)

### 3.1 Testing & Validation (Mandatory)

**Unit & Integration Testing:**
- ✓ All unit tests passing across all components
- ✓ Integration test suite passing

**E2E Testing:**
- ✓ Critical user workflows validated (E2E test suite)
- ✓ Backward compatibility testing with N-1 version
- ✓ Installation/upgrade path tested

**Performance & Load Testing:**
- ✓ Performance benchmarks show no regression > 10% vs. previous release
- ✓ Load testing validates system handles expected production load
- ✓ Resource utilization (CPU, memory) within acceptable bounds

**Note:** Automated testing is preferred for all scenarios. If a test scenario is not yet automated, it must be executed manually before release approval.

### 3.2 Bug Severity Gates (Mandatory)

- ✓ No open bugs with severity **Normal** or above (Blocker, Critical, Major, Normal)
    - Note: `Normal` bugs do not gate **MVP releases**
- ✓ Minor bugs:  No gate, tracked for future releases

### 3.3 Documentation Completeness (Mandatory)

**Release Documentation:**
- ✓ Release notes finalized (what's new, bug fixes, breaking changes)
- ✓ Known issues and limitations documented
- ✓ Deprecation notices published (if applicable)

**Operational Documentation:**
- ✓ Installation guide updated
- ✓ Upgrade instructions complete (N-1 → N)
- ✓ Deployment runbook created and reviewed

**Technical Documentation:**
- ✓ API documentation updated (if APIs changed)
- ✓ Configuration changes documented

### 3.4 Cross-Team Coordination

- ⚠ Integration validation with dependent offerings (TBD)

### 3.5 Security & Compliance

**Mandatory (All Phases):**
- ✓ Vulnerability scanning: No CRITICAL/HIGH CVEs in container images

**Post-MVP (Deferred to Konflux Migration):**
- ⚠ Supply chain security: SLSA Level 3 provenance generated
- ⚠ Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) generated
- ⚠ Container images signed with Sigstore/Cosign
- ⚠ Enterprise Contract Policy enforcement

**Note:** For MVP, focus on vulnerability scanning. Full supply chain security (SBOM, signing, provenance) will be implemented during Post-MVP Konflux migration.

### 3.6 Release Artifacts Verification (Mandatory)

- ✓ All container images built and pushed to registry
- ✓ Helm charts packaged and tested
- ✓ Git tags created with correct version
- ✓ Release artifacts checksums/signatures verified

**Gate Decision:** Only when ALL mandatory criteria are met can the release be declared GA-ready and published.

## 4. Bug Handling Workflow After Code Freeze

### 4.1 Bug Triage Process

When a bug is discovered after code freeze (during RC testing or late in release cycle):

```text
            Bug Reported
                 │
                 ↓
      ┌─────────────────────────┐
      │ Initial Assessment      │
      │ - Severity assignment   │
      │ - Reproducibility       │
      │ - Impact analysis       │
      └───────────┬─────────────┘
                  │
                  ↓
┌────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│          Severity-Based Routing            │
├──────────────┬──────────────┬──────────────┤
│ Blocker/     │    Major     │ Normal/Minor │
│ Critical     │              │              │
└──────┬───────┴──────┬───────┴──────┬───────┘
       │              │              │
       ↓              ↓              ↓
  [FIX NOW]    [TRIAGE MEETING]  [DEFER]
```

### 4.2 Decision Framework

**For Blocker/Critical bugs:**
1. **Immediate Action:** Developer assigned within 2 hours
2. **Fix & Test:** Root cause analysis, fix implementation, automated tests added
3. **Cherry-Pick:** Fix merged to `main` first, then cherry-picked to release branch
4. **New RC:** Cut new release candidate (e.g., v1.5.0-rc.3)
5. **Regression Testing:** Full test suite re-run
6. **Time Box:** If fix takes > 24 hours, consider release delay or degrading severity

**For Major bugs:**
1. **Before Code Freeze:** Major severity bugs must be fixed before GA release
   - **Release Owner Assessment:** Evaluate impact, risk, complexity, and timeline
   - **Fix & Include:** Implement fix and cherry-pick to release branch
   - **If Not Fixable in Timeline:**
     - Consider release delay to allow fix completion
     - OR downgrade severity if impact assessment justifies (requires stakeholder approval and documented rationale)
2. **During Code Freeze:** Major bugs must be either:
   - **Escalated to Critical:** With documented justification showing blocker-level impact to be included in the release
   - **Deferred to Next Patch:** Scheduled for the next patch release (e.g., v1.5.1) if impact does not warrant Critical escalation

**For Normal/Minor bugs:**
- Default: Defer to next patch release or next minor release
- Track in backlog for future releases

### 4.3 Post-Code Freeze PR Approval Process

All PRs to release branch after code freeze require:

1. **Justification:** PR description must include:
   - Bug severity and impact
   - Why fix cannot wait for patch release
   - Risk assessment (What could break?)
   - Test coverage added/modified

2. **Approval Chain:**
   ```text
   Developer → Code Review → Release Owner → Automated Tests → Merge
   ```
   - Minimum 2 approvals (1 technical reviewer + Release Owner)
   - Prow tests must be green
   - No approval bypasses allowed

3. **Communication:**
   - Post to release Slack channel for visibility
   - Update release tracking issue
   - Notify stakeholders if fix delays GA timeline

### 4.4 Hotfix Workflow (Post-GA)

For bugs discovered after GA release:

```bash
# Example assumes Sentinel component (v1.4.x)
# Create hotfix branch from component release tag
git checkout -b hotfix-1.4.3 v1.4.2

# Make fix, test, commit
git commit -m "Fix critical bug in Sentinel component"

# Merge to release branch
git checkout release-1.4
git merge --no-ff hotfix-1.4.3

# Tag component patch release
git tag -a v1.4.3 -m "Patch release v1.4.3"
git push origin release-1.4 --tags

# Cherry-pick to main if applicable
git checkout main
git cherry-pick <commit-sha>
```

**Hotfix Release Timeline:**
- Blocker/Critical severity: Patch release within 48 hours
- Major severity: Patch release within 1 week

### 4.5 Release Recovery Strategy

**HyperFleet uses a roll-forward recovery strategy for MVP releases.**

#### 4.5.1 Roll-Forward (Primary Strategy)

When issues are discovered in a GA release, the default recovery path is to **fix forward** via a patch release:

**Process:**
1. Identify and fix the issue in `main` branch
2. Cherry-pick fix to affected release branch
3. Cut patch release (e.g., v1.5.0 → v1.5.1)
4. Deploy patch following standard deployment procedures

**Timeline:**
- Blocker/Critical: Patch release within 48 hours
- Major: Patch release within 1 week

**Advantages:**
- Simpler testing scope (only test the fix)
- No database migration reversal complexity
- Maintains forward version progression
- Faster response for critical issues

#### 4.5.2 Rollback Support (Post-MVP)

**Status:** Deferred to Post-Q1 (separate epic required)

**Reference:** See [versioning trade-offs documentation](https://github.com/openshift-hyperfleet/architecture/blob/main/hyperfleet/docs/versioning-trade-offs.md#4-database-migration-and-rollback-procedures-post-mvp) for detailed rollback considerations.

**Decision Point:** Evaluate rollback support necessity after MVP based on:
- Incident frequency and severity
- Customer requirements for rollback capabilities
- Database schema stability
- Testing infrastructure maturity

---

## 5. Release Cadence

**Regular Releases:** Every 3 weeks (1 sprint) - ~17 releases per year
- Weeks 1-2: Active development
- Week 3: Feature freeze, stabilization, testing, GA release
  - Note: Duration may vary as CI/CD automation is being built

**Ad-Hoc Releases:** As needed for urgent requirements (3-5 days)
- Triggers: Critical bugs, security vulnerabilities, urgent business needs
- Reduced testing scope (unit, integration, E2E for affected components only)
- Release Owner approval required

**Cadence Refinement:**
As HyperFleet matures and based on retrospective data, the team may adjust the release cadence:
- If automation is strong and quality metrics support it, consider faster cycles
- If team coordination or integration complexity requires it, consider extending to 4 weeks
- Revisit cadence after every several releases during retrospectives

---

## 6. Release Artifacts and Deliverables

### 6.0 Release Repository

**Create: `openshift-hyperfleet/releases` repository**

A dedicated release repository serves as the single source of truth for all HyperFleet releases.

**Purpose:**
- Centralized release notes, installation guides, and upgrade documentation
- Defines validated component version combinations for each HyperFleet Release
- Release tracking issues and automation scripts
- User-facing documentation via GitHub Pages (optional)

**What goes in the release repository:**
- HyperFleet Release tags: `release-1.5`, `release-1.6` (marking validated component combinations)
- Release notes for each HyperFleet Release (`releases/release-1.5/release-notes.md`)
- Compatibility matrix for each release (which component versions work together)
- Installation and upgrade guides
- Links to component container images and artifacts
- Aggregated changelog from all components
- Release automation scripts

**What stays in component repositories:**
- Source code
- Component-specific git tags (e.g., `v1.5.0`, `v1.4.2`, `v2.0.0`)
- Component-specific Helm charts
- Component-specific CHANGELOGs
- Development documentation

**Benefits:** Single location for offering team to find all release information, clear component version combinations for each release, cleaner separation between component development and integrated release artifacts.

### 6.1 Primary Release Artifacts

**Container Images:**
- Built automatically by Prow on release tag creation
- Published to `registry.ci.openshift.org/hyperfleet/*`
- **Image naming:** Each component uses its own independent semantic version
  ```text
  registry.ci.openshift.org/hyperfleet/{component}:v{component-version}
  ```
- **Example for HyperFleet Release 1.5:**
  - `registry.ci.openshift.org/hyperfleet/api-service:v1.5.0`
  - `registry.ci.openshift.org/hyperfleet/sentinel:v1.4.2`
  - `registry.ci.openshift.org/hyperfleet/adapter-framework:v2.0.0`

  (Each component has its own version reflecting its actual changes per Section 2.5)

**Helm Charts:**
- Each component has its own Helm chart in component repositories
  - Note: Adapter Framework base chart is designed for overlay usage by business adapters, not standalone deployment
- Note: Umbrella chart strategy (hyperfleet-chart repo) is under discussion

**Git Tags:**
- Git tags created independently in component repositories: `vX.Y.Z` (reflecting each component's version)
- HyperFleet Release tag created in `openshift-hyperfleet/releases` repository: `release-X.Y` (single source of truth for the validated component combination - see Section 6.0)
- GitHub Releases created from tags with release notes and compatibility matrix

- No CRITICAL/HIGH CVEs in release

**Post-MVP (with Konflux):**
- Enterprise Contract Policy enforcement
- SBOM generation
- SLSA Level 3 provenance
- Image signing with Sigstore/Cosign

---

## 7. Konflux vs. Prow Comparison

### 7.1 Current State: Prow

**What Works:**
- Automated CI/CD pipeline (testing, image builds)
- GitHub integration
- Team familiarity

**What's Missing:**
- SLSA provenance, SBOM generation, image signing
- Requires additional tooling for supply chain security

### 7.2 Konflux Benefits

**Supply Chain Security:**
- SLSA Level 3 provenance, SBOM, Sigstore signing (built-in)
- **Enterprise Contract Policy enforcement**
- Integrated vulnerability scanning

**Release Automation:**
- Unified build-test-release workflow
- OCI artifact management
- Policy-as-code compliance gates

### 7.3 Recommendation

**MVP Approach:**
- **Use Prow + manual release process**
- Manual steps: branching, tagging, Helm packaging, GitHub Releases
- Defer security tooling to Post-MVP
- Focus: Establish process first, automate later

**Post-MVP Migration:**
- Migrate to Konflux for automated releases
- Add Enterprise Contract Policy enforcement
- Implement SBOM, provenance, signing automation

  - Publish release artifacts and documentation
  - Conduct post-release retrospective
- **Reference:** Sections 2, 3, 6

### 8.2 Post-MVP Improvements

#### 8.2.1 Conduct Retrospectives and Identify Improvements

After completing the first few releases with manual processes, conduct retrospectives to:
- Identify workflow pain points and bottlenecks
- Determine which manual steps should be automated
- Evaluate release process effectiveness (timing, quality gates, coordination)
- Gather feedback from Release Owners, developers, and stakeholders
- Update release procedures based on lessons learned
- Prioritize automation opportunities (Helm packaging, release notes generation, GitHub Releases)

#### 8.2.2 Migrate to Konflux for Official Releases

Transition from manual Prow-based releases to Konflux for production-grade, compliant releases:

##### Why Konflux

- **Enterprise Contract Policy** enforcement for compliance and security gates
- Makes releases more official with built-in governance
- SLSA Level 3 compliance (provenance, SBOM, signing)
- Unified build-test-release pipeline with policy-as-code

##### Migration Approach

- Evaluate Konflux with pilot project (test environment, parallel builds with Prow)
- Implement Enterprise Contract Policy framework and define policies
- Migrate all components to Konflux pipelines
- Automate SBOM generation, image signing, and provenance
- Full cutover after validation

#### 8.2.3 Additional Process Improvements

Based on retrospective findings and Konflux capabilities:
- Establish automated E2E test gate as mandatory release criteria
- Create release health monitoring dashboards
- Define SLI/SLO framework for release quality metrics
- Optimize release cadence based on data (6-month review)
- Consider LTS release designation (e.g., every 4th release)

### 8.3 Success Metrics

**Track and review quarterly:**

**Release Metrics:**
- HyperFleet Release frequency (target: ~17 releases/year with 3-week cadence)
- Component patch release frequency (individual component updates between HyperFleet Releases)
- Code freeze duration (target: < 1 week, ideally 3-4 days)
- On-time delivery (target: > 80% of HyperFleet Releases on schedule)
- Stabilization phase variance (track actual vs. planned to inform process improvements)

**Quality Metrics:**
- Bug escape rate (bugs found post-GA per component and per HyperFleet Release)
- Hotfix frequency per component (target: < 2 patch releases per component between HyperFleet Releases)
- Mean time to patch critical vulnerabilities (target: < 48 hours for any component)
- Cross-component compatibility issues found in production (target: 0)
